git pull https://github.com/hany-tawfik/hello-world

Git branch
Git branch -a
Git checkout HanyWS
Git pull

Git fetch : only tell you what is new but without pulling it to the Local.
I think that git fetch + git merge = git pull.

This week we continued working on the documentation part beside testing 3 commands from the madmom library which are:

spectral_flux()
super_flux()
RNNBeatProcessor()

 directly into the Raspberry Pi using Github.

Next week we will read more about Peak Picking algorithms and implement it on the Pi.
